![Terrible Tick, Redondo Beach California, 1997](/media/Tick-low.png)

I worked on visual effects a few years ago ([Digital Domain](http://www.digitaldomain.com) and [Boss Film Studios](http://www.vfxhq.com/houses/boss.html)). I worked with some really good people including three VFX academy award winners [Richard Edlund](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0249430/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1), [Kevin Mack](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0533034/?ref_=fn_al_nm_2), and [Jim Rygiel](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0753277/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1). I worked on some [cool projects](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0627816/#visual_effects).

I was the first person ever fired from Digital Domain and I ran the "Department of Space and Power" at Boss. After [this shot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAXO8qwlrQ8) closed the company, I joined [Shahril Ibrahim's](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0406567/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1) startup Media SuperCollier. We shut the doors when bandwidth cost exceeded the revenue we made on gamers. 

Mid '90s....Optical composites and stop motion animation were considered superior. Pixar was a software company. We animated [Sil](https://beforesandafters.com/2020/07/13/when-motion-capture-puppets-were-all-the-rage/), cloned [Lindsay Lohan](https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2020/07/21/789312.jpg), and made a [virus airborne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wy-w1-g7OvY). Good times.

My happy place is [Center Stage Vintage Guitars](https://www.instagram.com/centerstagevintageguitars/) and the Terrible Tick is not a water tower.
