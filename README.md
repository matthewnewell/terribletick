## Application for the Unreal Fellowship

![Terrible Tick, Redondo Beach California, 1997](/media/Tick-low.png)

I have four years experience developing digital visual effects for feature films ([Digital Domain](http://www.digitaldomain.com) and [Boss Film Studios](http://www.vfxhq.com/houses/boss.html)). That was a long time ago. I worked with some amazing people including three VFX academy award winners [Richard Edlund](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0249430/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1), [Kevin Mack](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0533034/?ref_=fn_al_nm_2), and [Jim Rygiel](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0753277/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1). 

I got to work on some [amazing projects](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0627816/#visual_effects).

At Boss Films, I ran the "Department of Space and Power" (data/disk management and CPU processing (render queue)). After [this shot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAXO8qwlrQ8) closed the company, I joined a startup created by Boss Film's R&D director [Shahril Ibrahim](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0406567/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1). Our mission was to blend movies and games into new forms of digital entertainment.  We shut the doors when our bandwidth cost exceeded the revenue we made on the people that played our games.

It was an amazing time to be in VFX. Optical composites and stop motion animation were still considered superior to their digital counterparts. Pixar was just a software company. We got to animate [Sil](https://beforesandafters.com/2020/07/13/when-motion-capture-puppets-were-all-the-rage/), clone [Lindsay Lohan](https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2020/07/21/789312.jpg), and make a [virus airborne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wy-w1-g7OvY).

I transitioned to the defense industry after the dot-com bubble burst. For the last several years I have been working on training systems for the [V-22 Osprey](https://www.raytheonintelligenceandspace.com/capabilities/products/v-22). My job is to help replace legacy training systems with Unreal Engine based simulations. This paradigm is an absolute game-changer for the United States Military. We can now quickly make realistic training applications that are playable anytime and anywhere and on low cost COTS hardware. We think this will be a high growth area for our company. 

One concept I hope to develop is called *Area of Interest Rapid Visualization (AIRV)*. The idea is to rapidly develop multiplayer worlds representative of first-responder threat situations. Stakeholders would then use the synthetic world for mission planning, rehearsal, and implementation oversight. Virtual worlds are not a new concept for our customers. What makes my idea unique is that I would like to leverage the UE game and cinema pipelines to build environments quickly enough so that they may be usable within minutes of incident start. Developing the skills needed to rapidly mature this concept is a significant motivator for my application to the Unreal Fellowship.

On the side I make digital content for [Center Stage Vintage Guitars](https://www.instagram.com/centerstagevintageguitars/). I use their social media feed to develop my skills with DCC apps and to tell stories. Music and vintage gear and the people I meet and jam with have become a wonderful part of my own story. Right up there with family and gardening.

I have been the "suit" for most of my career. My goal is to transition over to the creative side. This is another reason why I am applying to the Unreal Engine Fellowship. My aspiration is to be both storyteller and content creator. 

Terrible Tick (see above photo) is a short piece that I would like to develop with Unreal Engine. The tick is an alien parasite (not a water tower) that wakes up, steps over houses, punches holes in roofs, and sucks up people. All seems lost until the tick gets to the cat-lady's house.   

Thank you for your software and for offering this program. 

Best,

Matt Newell
