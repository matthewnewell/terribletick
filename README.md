## Application for the Unreal Fellowship

![run!](/media/TickReference1.png)

I have four years developing digital visual effects for feature films ([Digital Domain](www.digitaldomain.com) and [Boss Film Studios](http://www.vfxhq.com/houses/boss.html)). This was a long time ago. I worked with some amazing people including three VFX academy award winners [Richard Edlund](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0249430/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1), Kevin Mack(https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0533034/?ref_=fn_al_nm_2), and Jim Rygiel(https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0753277/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1). And I worked on some [amazing projects](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0627816/#visual_effects).

My job title was "Department of Space and Power" (data/disk and CPU (render queue)). After [this shot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAXO8qwlrQ8) closed the company, I joined Boss Film's R&D director [Shahril Ibrahim](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0406567/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1) on a startup called Media SuperCollider. Our mission was to blend movies and games into new forms of digital content.  We shut the doors when the cost of bandwidth exceeded the revenue we were making on the people that played our games.

Amazing time to be in VFX. Optical composites and stop motion were still considered superior to their digital counterparts. Pixar was still a software company. We hired pupeteers to animate [Sil](https://beforesandafters.com/2020/07/13/when-motion-capture-puppets-were-all-the-rage/), cloned [Lindsay Lohan](https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2020/07/21/789312.jpg), and took a [virus airborne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wy-w1-g7OvY).

I transitioned to the defense industry after the dot-com bubble and for the last several years have been working on training systems for the [V-22 Osprey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Boeing_V-22_Osprey). My job is to replace legacy training systems with Unreal-Engine based simulations. This training paradigm is an absolute game-changer for the United States Military. We can now quickly make realistic training applications that are playable anytime and anywhere on low cost COTS hardware. We think this will be a high growth area for our company. 

For most of my carreer I have been the "suit". My goal is to transition into content creation. This is why I am applying to the Unreal Engine Fellowship.

My weekend gig is with [Center Stage Vintage Guitars](https://www.instagram.com/centerstagevintageguitars/). I do all their online stuff and use their social media feed to develop my skills with digital content creation applications (mostly Davinchi Resolve and a little bit of Blender). I am bringing up the guitar shop in my application because your emphasis on storytelling. Music and vintage gear and the people we meet and jam with has become a wonderful chapter in my own story.

In case you are wondering, Terrible Tick is the product that I would like to develop if accepted into your Fellowship. It's an alien parasite (not a watertower) that walks over houses, punches holes in roofs, and sucks up people. All seems lost until the tick sucks up everything in the cat-lady's house. Turns out space aliens are allergic to cats.  

Thank you for offerring this program. 
Best,
Matt Newell
