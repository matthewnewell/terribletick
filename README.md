## Application for the Unreal Fellowship

![run!](/media/TickReference1.png)

I have four years developing digital visual effects for feature films ([Digital Domain](www.digitaldomain.com) and [Boss Film Studios](http://www.vfxhq.com/houses/boss.html)). This was a long time ago. I worked with some amazing people including three VFX academy award winners [Richard Edlund](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0249430/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1), [Kevin Mack](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0533034/?ref_=fn_al_nm_2), and [Jim Rygiel](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0753277/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1). 

I got to work on some [amazing projects](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0627816/#visual_effects).

My job title with Boss Films was "Department of Space and Power". I was responsible for data/disk management and CPU processing (render queue). After [this shot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAXO8qwlrQ8) closed the company, I joined a startup created by Boss Film's R&D director [Shahril Ibrahim](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0406567/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1). Our mission was to blend movies and games into new forms of digital entertainment.  We shut the doors when the cost of bandwidth exceeded the revenue we were making on the people that played our online games.

It was an amazing time to be in VFX. Optical composites and stop motion were still considered superior to their digital counterparts. Pixar was just a software company. We animated [Sil](https://beforesandafters.com/2020/07/13/when-motion-capture-puppets-were-all-the-rage/), cloned [Lindsay Lohan](https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2020/07/21/789312.jpg), and took a [virus airborne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wy-w1-g7OvY).

I transitioned to the defense industry after the dot-com bubble burst. For the last several years I have been working on training systems for the [V-22 Osprey](https://www.raytheonintelligenceandspace.com/capabilities/products/v-22). My job is to help replace legacy training systems with Unreal-Engine based simulations. This paradigm is an absolute game-changer for the United States Military. We can now quickly make realistic training applications that are playable anytime and anywhere and on low cost COTS hardware. We think this will be a high growth area for our company. 

I have been the "suit" for most of my career. My goal is to transition into content creation. This is why I am applying to the Unreal Engine Fellowship.

On weekends I work at [Center Stage Vintage Guitars](https://www.instagram.com/centerstagevintageguitars/). I do all of their digital content. I use their social media feed to develop my skills with DCC apps and storytelling. Music and vintage gear and the people I meet and jam with has become a wonderful chapter in my own story. Right up there with family and gardening.

Terrible Tick is a short piece that I would like to develop if accepted into your Fellowship. It's an alien parasite (not a watertower) that steps over houses, punches holes in roofs, and sucks up people. All seems lost until the tick gets to the cat-lady's house.   

Thank you for offerring this program. 
Best,
Matt Newell
